1) Write a function named avareage which takes a list of numbers and returns the average of numbers.
2) Write a function named maxima which takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum of numbers.
3) Write a program which read in grades from the user until she enters -1

4) threshold( l, thresh )
    This function takes an array of numbers, l, and a minimum value, thresh, and modifies that array such that any element in the array that is not above the minimum value is zeroed. 
    5)Write a function that takes two arguments, a number n and a character c and prints a square of size n by n on the screen.

e.g.

printSquare( 3, '$' )

$ $ $
$ $ $
$ $ $

Note the spaces between the characters. If you don't include these spaces, that's OK too. 
5)write a function that takes three arguments, width, height, and symbol, and prints a width by height rectangle of symbols on the screen.

% % % %
% % % %
% % % %
% % % %
% % % %
% % % %

 the space between the characters is optional, as long as the characters line up correctly.
