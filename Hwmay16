https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Ch1_Introduction_PyMC2.ipynb
Apply the example to yourself following the outline we have done in class.

2)What is the difference between  trace_4_3 = pm.sample(1000, tune=3000) and 
prior = pm.sample_prior_predictive(5000) 
pm_sample-posterior_predictive
